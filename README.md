# About

PawPal connects volunteers with local animal shelters/rescues to make it as easy as possible to find a place to make a difference.

Volunteers can search by zip code to access shelters in their area and select a time to volunteer.

Planned volunteer sessions show up on the home and user page for reference.

Rescue Owners can "claim" their shelters through the site and monitor scheduled volunteer times based on their individual needs.
