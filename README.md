# PawPal

http://paw-pal.herokuapp.com

#About
PawPal connects volunteers with local animal shelters/rescues to make it as easy as possible to find a place to make a difference. Volunteers can search by zip code to access shelters in their area and select a time to volunteer. Planned volunteer sessions show up on their home and user page for reference. Rescue Owners can also "claim" their shelters through the site and schedule volunteer times based on their individual needs.

#Basics

* Ruby on Rails back-end
* React front-end for live updating search functionality
* PetFinder API integration
* Foundation
* User authentication with Devise
* Capybara test suite
* Workflow organization with Trello
